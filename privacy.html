      <h2>Information Disclosure</h2>
      <p>Sangha Brands won’t transfer information about you to third parties for the purpose of providing or facilitating third-party advertising to you. We won’t sell information about you.</p>
      <p>We may share your personal information with third parties in some circumstances, including: (1) with your consent; (2) to a service provider or partner who meets our data protection standards; (3) when we have a good faith belief it is required by law, such as pursuant to a subpoena or another legal process; (4) when we have a good faith belief that doing so will help prevent imminent harm to someone, which is usually a duty required by law.</p>
      <p>If we are going to share your information in response to legal proceedings, we’ll give you notice so you can challenge it (for example by seeking court intervention), unless we’re prohibited by law or believe doing so may endanger others. We will object to requests for information about users of our services that we believe are improper.</p>
      <div class="spacer"></div>
      <h2>Data Storage</h2>
      <p>Sangha Brands uses third-party hosting services, such as Google Drive, for hardware, software, networking, storage, and related technology we need to run Sangha Brands. We maintain two types of logs: server logs and event logs. By using Sangha Brands Services, you authorize Sangha Brands to transfer, store, and use your information in the United Kingdom and any other country where we operate.</p>
      <div class="spacer"></div>
      <h2>Tracking &amp; Cookies</h2>
      <p>We may collect online identifiers with cookies, such as IP address, browser type and version, and pages you view. We also keep track of how you got to our site and any links you click on to leave our site. Once you leave our site, we do not track you. This information is analyzed and combined with similar information of other users and may be collected both on our site and on other sites in our client community.</p>
      <p>You can remove persistent cookies by following the directions found in your Internet browser’s “help” file. If you reject cookies, you may still use our site, but your ability to use some areas of our site may be limited. We use your website activity to assist us in offering you a personalized Web experience, assist you with technical support, diagnose problems with our server, and administer our websites, and to tailor our product and service offerings to you. This privacy statement covers the use of cookies by this site only and does not cover the use of cookies by any advertisers.</p>
      <p>Please bear in mind that Sangha Brands does not track you across the Internet. We track only your interactions within the Sangha Brands network (which encompasses &quot;SanghaBrands.com&quot; and custom domains hosted by Sangha Brands).</p>
      <p>Some third-party services that we use to provide services, such as Google Analytics, may place their own cookies in your browser. This Privacy Policy covers use of cookies by Sangha Brands only and not the use of cookies by third parties.</p>
      <div class="spacer"></div>
      <h2>Third Party Website Links</h2>
      <p>Some of our websites provide links to third party websites, such as those of our affiliates, business partners and social media platforms. We have no access to or control over their practices. Because Sangha Brands does not control the information policies or practices of these third party websites or platforms, you should review their privacy policies to learn more about how they collect and use personal information.</p>
      <div class="spacer"></div>
      <h2>Modifying or Deleting Your Personal Information</h2>
      <p>If you don&#x27;t want us to retain your personal information anymore, you can place your undeniable request by writing us at <a href="mailto:alo@sanghabrands.com" class="link-underline">alo@sanghabrands.com</a>. We will reply only for the purpose of confirming your request was received and aquiesced.</p>
      <div class="spacer"></div>
      <h2>Emails from Sangha Brands</h2>
      <p>Sometimes we’ll send you emails about service changes or new policies. You can’t opt out of this type of “transactional” email. But, you can opt out of non-administrative emails such as digests, newsletters, and activity notifications through a request to <a href="mailto:alo@sanghabrands.com" class="link-underline">alo@sanghabrands.com</a>.</p>
      <p>When you interact with an email sent from Sangha Brands (such as clicking on a particular link in an email), we may receive information about that interaction. We won’t email you to ask for your password or other account information. If you receive such an email, please send it to us so we can investigate.</p>
      <div class="spacer"></div>
      <h2>Emails from Sangha Brands</h2>
      <p>Sangha Brands may periodically update this Policy. We’ll notify you about significant changes to it. The most current version of the policy will always be here and we will archive former versions of the policy here.</p>
